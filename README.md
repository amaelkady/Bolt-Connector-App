## Bolt Connector App
A GUI tool for generating the full-range trilinear force-elongation tensile response of high-strength steel bolts, considering uncertainty. This can be used in FE models where the bolt is modeled as an axial connector or in mechanical component-based models where the bolt is modeled as an axial spring. The model is applicable to most bolted connections where the bolts under dominant tension (i.e., with shear to tension ratio less than 0.2) such as endplate, t-stub, and top&seat angle connections.
