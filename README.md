## Bolt Connector App
A GUI tool for generating the full-range trilinear force-elongation response of high-strength steel bolts, considering uncertainty. This can be used in FE models where the bolt is modeled as an axial connector or in mechanical component-based models where the bolt is modeled as an axial spring.
